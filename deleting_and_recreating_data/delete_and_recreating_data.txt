if any misktakes made in migrations, deleting the migrations in migrate folder is good but at the same time we need to deleted that in database(data_migrate table) is also important. to delete that go to data_migrate tabe delete all the rows in where app='blog'.
And delete the tables created using this migrate.
Now again run the migrate command to apply the changes to the database, now your migrations will be added and the tables will be created but the data is lost.
to regenerate the data run the populate_categories and populate_posts.

there is another command to delete all data in the table that is flush,
    python manage.py flush
this will delete all the data
